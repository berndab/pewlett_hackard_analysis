-- The requirement for the employee mentorship cadidate
-- query was not well defined. It stated that the query
-- required TWO inner joins.
--
--  "Youâ€™ll need to use two inner joins to 
--   create this new table."
--
-- If the query used the from_date and to_date fields 
-- from the titles table, then the query would only have ONE 
-- inner join. It did not specify what additional table 
-- should be used and if the from_date or the to_date
-- field from the table to use in the second inner join
-- should be used as fields in the SELECT statement. 
--
-- I raised this issue with a TA and she stated that the
-- second inner join should be wiht the dept_emp table and
-- that the to_date and from_date in that table should be
-- used as fields in the SELECT statement.
